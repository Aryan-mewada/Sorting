# Sorting
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Sort
A simple Java program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using basic comparison and swapping. It demonstrates fundamental sorting logic and use of classes, loops, and arrays.
## üìÑ Description
The program takes `n` integer inputs from the user and arranges them in ascending order without using any built-in sorting functions.  
It demonstrates the concept of sorting using nested loops and swapping of elements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. User enters the number of elements.
2. Program takes all inputs and stores them in an array.
3. Sorting is done using simple comparison and swap.
4. Final sorted array is displayed.

## üß† Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Basic Sorting Logic

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bubble Sort
# Bubble Sort in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.  
It sorts an array of integers in ascending order using simple comparison and swapping logic.

## üí° Description
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
The largest element "bubbles up" to the end after each pass.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. User inputs the total number of elements.
2. Elements are stored in an array.
3. The program compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.
4. After each iteration, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.

## üß† Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Swapping Logic  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Insertion Sort
# Insertion Sort in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.  
It sorts an array of integers in ascending order by inserting each element into its correct position.

## üí° Description
Insertion Sort works like sorting playing cards in your hands.  
Each new element is compared with the already sorted portion of the array and inserted where it belongs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. User inputs the total number of elements.  
2. Elements are stored in an array.  
3. The program picks one element (key) at a time.  
4. It shifts larger elements to the right and inserts the key in the correct position.  
5. After all insertions, the array becomes sorted.

## üß† Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Insertion Logic

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Selection Sort
# Selection Sort in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  
It sorts an array of integers in ascending order by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part and moving it to the sorted part.

## üí° Description
Selection Sort divides the array into two parts ‚Äî sorted and unsorted.  
It finds the smallest element from the unsorted section and swaps it with the first unsorted element, gradually expanding the sorted portion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. User inputs the total number of elements.  
2. Elements are stored in an array.  
3. The program selects the smallest element in each pass.  
4. It swaps that element with the current position.  
5. After all passes, the array becomes fully sorted.

## üß† Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Swapping Logic
