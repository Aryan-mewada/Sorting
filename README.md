# Sorting
A simple Java program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using basic comparison and swapping. It demonstrates fundamental sorting logic and use of classes, loops, and arrays.
## 📄 Description
The program takes `n` integer inputs from the user and arranges them in ascending order without using any built-in sorting functions.  
It demonstrates the concept of sorting using nested loops and swapping of elements.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters the number of elements.
2. Program takes all inputs and stores them in an array.
3. Sorting is done using simple comparison and swap.
4. Final sorted array is displayed.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Basic Sorting Logic
