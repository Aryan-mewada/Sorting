# Sorting
## 1️⃣ Simple Sort
A simple Java program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using basic comparison and swapping. It demonstrates fundamental sorting logic and use of classes, loops, and arrays.
## 📄 Description
The program takes `n` integer inputs from the user and arranges them in ascending order without using any built-in sorting functions.  
It demonstrates the concept of sorting using nested loops and swapping of elements.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters the number of elements.
2. Program takes all inputs and stores them in an array.
3. Sorting is done using simple comparison and swap.
4. Final sorted array is displayed.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Basic Sorting Logic

## 2️⃣ Bubble Sort
# Bubble Sort in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.  
It sorts an array of integers in ascending order using simple comparison and swapping logic.

## 💡 Description
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
The largest element "bubbles up" to the end after each pass.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User inputs the total number of elements.
2. Elements are stored in an array.
3. The program compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.
4. After each iteration, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- Loops (`for`)  
- Class and Object  
- User Input (Scanner)  
- Swapping Logic
